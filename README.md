A Web server MVC framework inspired by the functionality of Ruby on Rails

Comes with my ActiveRecordLite, which builds model classes connected to tables in a relational database.

Example Project: https://github.com/aellison1558/RailsLiteTODOApp

To use:

-Fill in SQL file (sql_file.sql) with desired tables.

-Create appropriate models, controllers, and views in provided folders

  -Models must have require_relative('./active_record_base') at top

  -Controllers must have require_relative('./controller_base') and must also require the associated model

  -Views must be placed in a folder within views named after their controller, ex: "examples_controller"

-Write routes in app.rb within router.draw block

  -app.rb must require all controller files in order to connect routes with controller actions

-From command line in directory, run 'ruby app.rb' to begin server
-Navigate to Localhost:3000 in browser to see site
